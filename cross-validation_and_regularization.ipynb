    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "High bias is easy to wrap one's mind around: Imagine pulling three red balls from an urn that has hundreds of balls of all colors in a uniform distribution. Then my sample is a terrible representative of the whole population. If I were to build a model by extrapolating from my sample, that model would predict that _every_ ball produced would be red! That is, this model would be incredibly biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "High variance is a little bit harder to visualize, but it's basically the \"opposite\" of this. Imagine that the population of balls in the urn is mostly red, but also that there are a few balls of other colors floating around. Now imagine that our sample comprises a few balls, none of which is red. In this case, we've essentially picked up on the \"noise\", rather than the \"signal\". If I were to build a model by extrapolating from my sample, that model would be needlessly complex. It might predict that balls drawn before noon will be orange and that balls drawn after 8pm will be green, when the reality is that a simple model that predicted 'red' for all balls would be a superior model!\n",
    "\n",
    "The important idea here is that there is a *trade-off*: If we have too few data in our sample (training set), or too few predictors, we run the risk of high *bias*, i.e. an underfit model. On the other hand, if we have too many predictors (especially ones that are collinear), we run the risk of high *variance*, i.e. an overfit model.\n",

    "\n",
    "I can build a model on some data. Then, **before** I introduce the model to the testing data, I can introduce it to a different batch of data (the validation set). With respect to the validation data I can do things like measure error and tweak model parameters to minimize that error. Of course, I also don't want to lose sight of the error on the training data. If the model error has been minimized on the training error, then of course any changes I make to the model parameters will take me away from that minimum. But still the new information I've gained by looking at the model's performance on the validiation data is valuable. I might for example go with a kind of compromising model whose parameters produce an error that's not too big on the training data and not too big on the validation data.\n",
